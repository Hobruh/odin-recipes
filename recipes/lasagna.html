<h4>Preparation</h4>
<h5>Sauce</h5>
<h6>Step 1</h6>
<p>
Warm 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy large pot over medium-high heat. 
Cook 1 lb. spicy Italian sausage, casings removed, 1 medium onion, finely chopped, 3 large garlic cloves, 
chopped, 2 tsp. dried oregano, and ¼ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, stirring often and breaking up sausage 
into small pieces, until sausage is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Add one 28-oz. can crushed tomatoes 
with added purée and one 14.5-oz. can diced tomatoes with green peppers and onions. Bring to boil, then 
reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors are melded, about 5 minutes. Season with 
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Do Ahead: Sauce can be made 1 day ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.
</p>
<h5>Filling</h5>
<h6>Step 2</h6>
<p>
Pulse 1½ cups (packed) fresh basil leaves in a food processor until finely chopped. 
Add 1 large egg, one 15-oz. container plus 1 cup part-skim ricotta cheese, 6 oz. low-moisture mozzarella 
cheese, coarsely grated (about 1½ cups), 2 oz. Parmesan cheese, coarsely grated (about ¾ cup), ½ tsp. 
Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and ¼ tsp. freshly ground black pepper. Pulse until combined 
but still a little chunky.
</p>
<h5>Assembly</h5>
<h6>Step 3</h6>
<p>
Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat oven to 375°. Spread 1¼ cups of meat sauce in a 13x9" glass 
baking dish. Arrange 3 no-boil lasagna noodles in a single layer over sauce. Spoon 1½ cups ricotta 
mixture over the layer of noodles and spread it from edge to edge. Scatter ¾ cup coarsely grated 
low-moisture mozzarella cheese and ¼ cup coarsely grated Parmesan cheese evenly over. Starting with 
another layer of sauce, repeat process 2 more times. Arrange remaining 3 noodles on top; spread remaining 
sauce over the noodles. Scatter remaining mozzarella and Parmesan evenly over.
</p>
<h6>Step 4</h6>
<p>
Coat a large piece of foil with nonstick cooking spray. Cover lasagna with foil, coated side down, 
and bake 40 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 400°. Carefully remove foil from lasagna and 
continue to bake until edges are golden and puffed, noodles are tender, and tomato sauce is bubbling, 
about 20 minutes longer. Let cool 15 minutes before serving.

Do ahead: Lasagna can be assembled 3 days in advance. Refrigerate unbaked in lasagna pan or 
freeze for up to 3 months. Bake frozen lasagna as above, adding 10–15 minutes onto the cook time 
before removing foil.
