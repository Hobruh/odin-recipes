Gravlax
</h1>
<p>Lets make Gravlax! Gravlax literally means "buried salmon", referring to the ancient practice of
curing raw fish by burying it in sand by the seashore to be saturated and cured by ocean tides. No open-faced
sandwich selection would be complete without this, one of Scandanavia's most distinctive dishes.</p>
